Personal Content Management Android Application


Major Components:

SQLite Databases - This project implements SQLite databases using the database software local to Android (This project
was done on Nexus 7 tablets)
Events Database - This database holds all the user-created events for display and editing on the Events screen
Notes Database - This database holds all the user-created notes for display and editing from the Notes section of the 
application.
Views - This project implements multiple views for the user to switch between for different sections of the application
ViewFlipper - This view takes care of the slideshow on the opening screen
AssignmentDetail - This view brings up the details of a specific assignment for the user to edit or create, including 
text fields and a date spinner
AssignmentOverview - This view shows all the currently stored assignments, and allows the user to add events or delete 
assignments. When an assignment is clicked on, the user is taken to the AssignmentDetail view.
Notes - This view implements the note-taking feature of the application. It allows the user to both view notes and edit 
and create new notes.
RSSFeed - This view allows the user to view content from specific RSS feeds and make them into events stored in the 
system. User cannot currently add their own RSS feeds.
RSSItemDetailActivity - This view is brought up when the user clicks on an RSS feed event and shows the details and 
allows the event to be added to the assignments list

Not Yet Completed

Notifications - Given more time, we would’ve liked to implement a notification system. We have the main code for the 
notifications in the project, but it does not currently work with our system. All that needs to be done is to compare 
all the items in the ListView (harder than it sounds) to the current date and throw a notification if they match.
Add User-given RSS Feeds - We current have hard-coded RSS feeds that the user can switch between, but they cannot 
currently add their own RSS feeds to the list. This feature would be good, but it is a bit too complicated for us to 
implement at this time.
Add Google Drive Functionality - the Note function is a primitive version of Drive functionality, as this would allow 
the user to access their notes later from any location that can access their Drive account.


Functionality

On the opening screen, the user sees a slideshow of Xavier-related pictures and a SlidingDrawer that contains the views 
that the user can switch to. From the SlidingDrawer, which is pulled up from the bottom of the screen, the user can 
navigate to the Notes view, the Assignments view, the Event view, or the Caf menu. 
The Caf menu button takes the user to the DineOnCampus Xavier website, from which the user can view the Caf’s menu for 
the day. 
The Event view allows the user to switch between RSS feeds by clicking a drop-down menu from the top-center of the view 
and selecting their desired RSS feed. The feed items can be clicked on to display the event details and to allow the 
event to be added to the Assignments list. 
The Assignments view contains all the current assignments, and allows the user to edit, create, and delete events. 
Clicking on an event allows the user to edit it, while a button allows the user to create new assignments (labeled 
“Create Assignment”), and holding down your finger on the event will bring up a toast (a short message to the user) in 
which the user must click on the Delete option in order to delete the chosen Assignment. When a user chooses to create 
or edit an assignment, a new view is brought up from which the user can add a title, a class, a professor, a summary, 
and a due date. The due date is chosen by a DateSpinner, while the other fields are all TextFields. Buttons in the top 
of the view labeled “Confirm” and “Add to Calendar” allow the user to add the assignment to the database or to add the 
assignment to their Google Calendar, which is linked through the Android API. 
Lastly, the Notes view allows the user to create, edit and store notes in much the same fashion as the Assignments. A note is made up of a title and a body, each of which are TextFields. The “Submit” button allows the user to submit and store the note, while the “Clear” button clears the TextFields.
